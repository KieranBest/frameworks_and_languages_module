Server Framework Features
-------------------------

### Middleware 

Middleware functions handle the routing protocols by having access to request and response objects working between cycles. Middleware is executed after the server receives the request but before a response is sent. The request object represents the HTTP request and enables the use of parameters and query string from the url, whereas the response object is the returning data such as the requested data amd HTTP status code.

`req.query` contains a property for a query parameter and is defined in the route using a '?key=value'.

``` Javascript
app.get('/items', (req,res) => {
    if (req.query.user_id)
    {
        res.status(200).json(Object.values(Item).filter(obj => obj.user_id == req.query.user_id))
        return;
    }
    res.status(200).json(Object.values(Item))
})
```

`req.params` contains a property for a parameter defined by the route using '#'.

``` Javascript
app.get('/item/:id', (req,res) => {
    if(Item[req.params.id] === undefined){
        res.status(404).json("Item not found")
    }
    else{
        res.status(200).json(Item[req.params.id])
    }
})
```

This enables us to handle requests and provide the necessary response. For example, return the HTTP status code followed by the specific Item requested in the json format.

### Routing

Routing is how the express framework handles responses to client requests. Routing is defined through methods of the Express app and handles `get()`, `post()` and `delete()` requests.

```javascript
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
    res.status(200).send('<html><body>Your HTML text</body></html>')
})
```
This enables the server the ability to wait for HTTP requests that match the specified routes then carry out its reponse, in this case, to return a HTML page displaying "Your HTML text".

Server Language Features
-----------------------

### Standard Library

The standard library of JavaScript is small in comparison to most languages because of its usability. JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted compiled programming language, it is most known for use creating dynamic and interactive web content, however it is also used for non-browser environments too. 

Some of its features include the:
 - Date Objects
        - Returns the current date and time with specificity down to the millisecond
``` Javascript
date_from: new Date().toJSON().slice(0,10),
```
 - Objects
``` Javascript
app.delete('/item/:id', (req,res) => {
    if (Object.keys(Item).includes(req.params.id)){
```

The Date object allows various outputs for the user to choose from such as milliseconds, minutes, hours, months, years, etc. giving the user full control of how detailed a time stamp is needed.

Object handling of 'key' and 'value' objects enable a dictionary like relationship allowing us to alter or locate either part of the object.

[Date Methods](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_date_methods.asp)
[Objects](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp)


### `Array Filter()`

The filter method enables us to search through an array and return the entry with the same value by creating a shallow copy.

``` Javascript
res.status(200).json(Object.values(Item).filter(obj => obj.user_id == req.query.user_id))
```
This enables us to easily search through a large dataset and find the specific entry without having to change the original array.

Client Framework Features
-------------------------

### Form Input Bindings

`v-model` create a 2 way link that binds the value within a form to that of a value within our data properties. The 2 way link is very important as it enables us to access this and change if needed.

```html
<input id="middle-label" v-model="Item.user_id" name="user_id" type="text" placeholder="type your name in">
```
Using `v-model="Item.user_id"` allows the DOM input element access to create a new data input in the `Item.user_id` field. 
Without this we would need to manually connect the input text box with a event listener to automatically update the data input when a change occurs.

[Form Input Bindings](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/forms.html)

### List Rendering

`v-for` is used to render a list of items within an arrray. Much like that of JavaScripts `forEach()` method, it enables us to cycle through elements within an array and display in HTML.

```html
<li v-for="Item in Items">
     <div class="grid-container">
          <div class="grid-x grid-margin-x">
              <div class="medium-6 cell">
                  <div class="card">
                    <div class="card-divider">
                      <h4><span data-field="id">{{Item.user_id}}</span></h4>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card-section">
                      <img :src="Item.image">
                      <div class="card-section">
                        <dl>
                          <dt>Keywords: </dt>
                          <dd>{{Item.keywords}}</dd>
                          <dt>Description: </dt>
                          <dd>{{Item.description}}</dd>
                          <dt>Latitude: </dt>
                          <dd>{{Item.lat}}</dd>
                          <dt>Longitude: </dt>
                          <dd>{{Item.lon}}</dd>
                          <!--Individual delete button for each Item-->
                          <br><button class="button" @click="delete_item(Item.id)" data-action="delete">Delete</button>
```
In this code snippet `v-for` has been used to list through the array with the source of the array `Items` and then iterate through each of its elements `Item`. Without this every element would have to be manually declared through JavaScript, converted to HTML and given its own HTML tags.

[v-for](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/list.html#v-for)

### Interpolation

Using the mustache tag (`{{ }}`) the value of declared property from the corresponding component will be displayed. There are 4 types of interpolation that vue supports, these are:
- Text
- JavaScript Expressions
- Raw HTML
- Attributes

```html
 <li v-for="Item in Items">
        <div class="grid-container">
          <div class="grid-x grid-margin-x">
              <div class="medium-6 cell">
                  <div class="card">
                    <div class="card-divider">
                      <h4><span data-field="id">{{Item.user_id}}</span></h4>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card-section">
                      <img :src="Item.image">
                      <div class="card-section">
                        <dl>
                          <dt>Keywords: </dt>
                          <dd>{{Item.keywords}}</dd>
                          <dt>Description: </dt>
                          <dd>{{Item.description}}</dd>
                          <dt>Latitude: </dt>
                          <dd>{{Item.lat}}</dd>
                          <dt>Longitude: </dt>
                          <dd>{{Item.lon}}</dd>
```

In the above snippet we have already understood that `v-for` will display all Items in Item; using the mustache syntax, we are able to access and display each attribute within the Item.

Client Language Features
------------------------

### `this`

The `this` keyword refers to a object that is dependent on how it is being called. It can't be set during execution and will be different each time called.

```javascript
   this.clearItem()
```

`this` can be used as a hidden parameter of a function and will change to suit its functions needs therefore can make retrieving an object for example, more simplistic and accessible. 

### `let`, `const` & `var`

`let` and `const` were released in the ES2015 update and are an alternative to `var`. Declaring a variable as `var` enables the user to access this variable publicly and enable them to be redeclared. However, declaring a variable using `let` or `const` means they are block scoped and bounded to where they are defined. It is more common to use `let` and `const` these days unless working in a browser pre-2015.
When choosing which keyword to use to declare a variable it must be considered that `const` variables cannot be changed once declared whereas `let` variables are changeable.

```javascript
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
```
The `urlParams` never needs to change once it is declared and is therefore declared as a `const`.

Critique of Server/Client prototype
---------------------

### While True

```python
while True:
            s.listen()
            try:
                conn, addr = s.accept()
            except KeyboardInterrupt as ex:
                break
            with conn:
                #log.debug(f'Connected by ')
                #while True:
                    data = conn.recv(65535)  # If the request does not come though in a single recv/packet then this server will fail and will not composit multiple TCP packets. Sometimes the head and the body are sent in sequential packets. This happens when the system switches task under load.
                    #if not data: break
                    try:
                        request = parse_request(data)
                    except InvalidHTTPRequest as ex:
                        log.exception("InvalidHTTPRequest")
                        continue
```


`while True` creates a infinite loop that cannot be stopped without forceful interference, it remains active and waiting for a request or response.
