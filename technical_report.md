Server Framework Features
-------------------------

### Middleware IS THE FEATURE RE-DO THIS AND MAKE MIDDLEWARE THE FEATURE THAT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE REQUEST AND RESPONSE



express.json() is a built-in middleware function in Express.

The request object represents the HTTP request and enables the use of parameters and query string from the url. req.query contains a property for a query parameter and is defined in the route using a '?key=value'.

```

This is beneficial because it enables us to use the query string without having to manually decode the url and enables us to search, sort, filter etc. our data.

Server Language Features
-----------------------

### Standard Library

The standard library of javascript is small in comparison to python because of the usability of javascript and its intended purpose. It is intended to create dynamic and interactive web content and therefore does not need as many features.
Some of its features include the:
    1. "new Date()" constructor 
        - Returns the current date and time with specificity down to the millisecond
```
date_from: new Date().toJSON().slice(0,10),
```
    2. go on w3 schools and find another
